Labeling, and a Defined Vocabulary for Content Moderation
---------------------------------------------------------

`draft` `optional` `author:s3x-jay` `author:rabble`

### Purpose

To provide a standardized way for content to be labeled both when it is published (by the author) or after the fact (by third parties or the original author), and to specify a defined vocabulary for content moderation.

## Labeling System

The labeling system defined here accommodates structured labeling from _any_ defined vocabulary, as well as free form unstructured labeling. 

### Structured labels

Structured labels are made up of two parts:
- The code indicating which defined vocabulary is being used (referred to as `vocab` below)
- The code from the defined vocabulary (referred to as `code` below)

Both `vocab` and `code` must be short ASCII strings with no spaces. If the common name of a vocabulary has a space in it (e.g. ISO 3166-2) it shall be the convention to replace the space with a dash.

The value of the structured label would be "`vocab`>`code`"

Two `vocab` values are reserved:
- MOD (for the moderation vocabulary defined below)
- \# (for adding hashtags)

Organizations may label events with their own proprietary coding systems. They should use care selecting their unique `vocab` value to ensure it doesn't confict with values used by others or the values for well-known defined vocabularies. Organizations who publish events with proprietary vocabularies are encouraged to publish those vocabularies to Nostr so they can be used by others. [TO-DO: Need to define how to publish proprietary vocabularies to Nostr.] Repeated, intentional use of `vocab` values that conflict with the common names of well-known defined vocabularies will be considered spam.

_Examples:_
- "MeSH>D005528" would add the label ["Foot"](https://meshb.nlm.nih.gov/record/ui?ui=D005528) from NIH's Medical Subject Headings vocabulary
- "#>footster" would allow fans of Footster to add the hashtag #footster to someone's post
- "GeoNames>3173435" would add a label specifying [Milan, Italy](https://www.geonames.org/3173435/milan.html) using the GeoNames coding system
- "ISO-3166-2>IT-MI" would add a label specifying Milano, Italy using ISO 3166-2.

[TO-DO: Need to introduce the OPTIONAL concepts of `severity` and `confidence`. They should be tied to a particular label if multiple labels are specified.]

### Unstructured labels

While defined vocabularies may be used heavily by automated systems regular users need the ability to add free form labels. Unstructured labels are handled separately, as discussed below.

_Example:_ 
- "Sandals from Milan"

### Labeling when a note is published

Any event of any kind may add labels relevant to its `content`. It shall do this using the following tags:
- `l` for structured labels
- `label` for unstructured labels

Clients MUST use one `l` tag for each structured label which may result in multiple `l` tags. However there may only be one `label` tag. A value of "#" for `vocab` MUST NOT be used when content is originally being published as it would be redundant with the `t` tag.

'l' tags may be extended with additional relevant information. 

_Example:_ 

```json
{
    "pubkey": "<pub-key>",
    "created_at": 1000000000,
    "kind": 1,
    "tags": [
      ["t", "Footster"],
      ["l", "MeSH>D005528"],
      ["l", "GeoNames>3173435"],
      ["l", "ISO-3166-2>IT-MI"],
      ["label", "Sandals from Milan"] 
    ],
    "content": "Look at the great sandals I picked up in Milan! I love how my feet look in them… https://domain.com/image.jpg",
    "id": "<event-id>"
}
```

This NIP deprecates use of NIP-36 and the `content-warning` tag. Going forward content warnings will use labels from the defined moderation vocabulary described below.

### Labeling an event after initial publication

Labeling after initial publication will use ([parameterized replaceable](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips/blob/master/33.md)) kind 32144. 

[Below here document is still needs a lot of work]

Thoughts…
- Kind 1984 can be reused for moderator action reports
- I'm struggling with the proper use of the various tags in parameterized replaceable events. We're replacing based on a search of `author`+`kind`+`eventid` being labeled. What's the best way to do that?


## Defined Vocabulary for Content Moderation

Just as MeSH helps scientists and medical professionals communicate effectively and find articles on a particular topic quickly, people (and automated agents) performing content moderation tasks on Nostr need a defined vocabulary to communicate effectively and find and act on particular types of moderation reports quickly. 

This vocabulary is required because relay owners need to stay compliant with their local laws and the standards of the communities they serve, and client apps need to cater to the preferences of their users and sometimes to the standards imposed by the app stores they're listed in. 

There is no requirement for anyone to use the entire vocabulary or even any portion of it. Different parts of the vocabulary are relevant in some regions and not in others. Clients apps and moderators will only use the portion of the vocabulary that applies to their particular situation. Some may ignore moderation tasks completely. 

The fact that something is in the moderation vocabulary says nothing about the ethical or moral quality of the content being labeled. 

Client apps which support content reporting SHOULD not overwhelm users with too choices. Sub-categories should only be displayed after the user chooses the general category. Client apps are further encouraged to make use of geolocation data, if available, to hide categories/sub-categories that are not relevant in the user's country or region.

Because labels now use replaceable events, this NIP deprecates NIP-56. Kind 1984 will be repurposed for moderation action reports.

### Reportable Types

These types expand and standardize the `report type` defined in NIP-56. Existing NIP-56 report types (`Old Code` in table below) should be supported by clients for backwards compatibility, but should not otherwise be used in future development.

**_Format:_ AB-cde**
- where 'AB' is a mandatory 2 character, uppercase code of a major content type category
- and 'cde' is an optional 3 character, lowercase code representing a sub-category

TypeCode | Old Code | Type | Notes
--- | --- | --- | ---
CL | profanity |  Coarse Language / Profanity |
HC-fin |  | Promotion of content that is likely to cause financial ruin | consider also IL-frd
HC-bhd |  | Promotion of content that is likely to cause serious bodily harm or death |
IH |  | Intolerance & Hate | does not include intolerance of intolerance |
IL | illegal | Illegal Content | post/profile is illegal or advocates illegal activity
IL-cop |  | Copyright violation, piracy, intellectual property theft |
IL-csa |  | Child sexual abuse and/or trafficking |
IL-drg |  | Drug-related crime |
IL-frd |  | Fraud & Scams |
IL-har |  | Harassment / stalking / doxxing |
IL-hkr |  | Prostitution | see: https://github.com/s3x-jay/nostr-nips/blob/master/69.md
IL-idt |  | Identity theft / phishing |
IL-mal |  | Malware / viruses / ransomware |
IM | impersonation | Impersonation | consider also IL-idp
NS | nudity | Nudity & Sex |
NS-nud |  | Casual nudity |
NS-ero |  | Erotica |
NS-sex |  | Sex |
PG |  | No Sensitive Content | for use in situations where sensitive content might be assumed
PN |  | Pornography |
PN-het |  | Heterosexual porn |
PN-gay |  | Gay male porn | see: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGBT_rights_by_country_or_territory
PN-les |  | Lesbian porn |
PN-bis |  | Bisexual porn |
PN-trn |  | Transsexual porn |
PN-fnb |  | Gender-fluid / non-binary porn |
SP | spam | Spam |
SP-mod |  | Moderation report spam |
VI |  | Violence | actual or advocated |
VI-hum |  | Violence towards a human being |
VI-ani |  | Violence towards a sentient animal |

### Contexts

Contexts are situations where otherwise objectionable content might be allowed.

**_Format:_ AB**
- where 'AB' is a mandatory 2 character, uppercase code of a major content type category

ContextCode | Context
--- | ---
ED | Educational
FA | Fine Art
FF | Fantasy / Fiction
MS | Medical / Scientific
ND | News & Documentaries
PP | Political Protest

### How to use type and context codes

Only the codes (`TypeCode` and `ContextCode` above) should go over the wire. The descriptions and notes should only be used in user interfaces.

#### Use with NIP-56 after the fact reports

To use with NIP-56 simply replace the original 5 defined report types (`Old Code` above) with the 2 or 6 character codes above.

The one change to NIP-56 (or clarification) is that the value passed may be a comma delimited list to support specifying multiple report types or contexts.

#### Use with NIP-36 self-reporting

```
tag: content-warning
options:
 - [reason]: may be a null or blank
 - [codes]: mandatory
```
The [reason] option was defined in NIP-36. It may be null or a blank string.

An additional mandatory option is added to the content-warning tag - [codes] - which contains a comma delimited list of relevant content type and context codes.

##### Content warnings for particular components of a profile

If NIP-36 is being used to self-report one's profile the user may classify the entire profile and/or just parts of a profile by appending the item name for the applicable part of the profile to the content type or context code. For example:

- AB-cde (would apply to the entire profile)
- AB-cde-picture (would apply to the user's avatar only)
- AB-cde-website (would apply to the link in the user's profile)

Item names used must match items specified in the `content` section of the (Kind 0) event.

### Examples

#### Example 1 - Post with photos from a wet t-shirt contest

Self-reporting the post...
```json
{
    "pubkey": "<pub-key>",
    "created_at": 1000000000,
    "kind": 1,
    "tags": [
      [ "t", "WetTShirt" ],
      [ "l", "MOD>NS-ero" ],
      [ "label", "Wet t-shirt contest" ]
    ],
    "content": "(Racy content goes here)",
    "id": "<event-id>"
}
```
After the fact reporting of same post...
```json
{
  "kind": 1984,
  "tags": [
    [ "e", <eventId>, "MOD>NS-ero" ],
    [ "p", <pubkey> ]
  ],
  "content": "Wet t-shirt contest"
}
```

#### Example 2 - Profile of organization offering life drawing classes

Self-reporting of an entire profile...
```json
{
"id": "<event-id>"
    "pubkey": "<pub-key>",
    "created_at": 1000000000,
    "kind": 0,
    "tags": [
      [ "t", "LifeDrawing" ],
      [ "l", "MOD>NS-nud" ],
      [ "l", "MOD>FA" ]
    ],
    "content": "{\"name\":\"OttawaLifeDrawing\",\"about\":\"Ottawa's newest life drawing classes!\"}"
}
```
After the fact reporting of same profile...
```json
{
  "kind": 1984,
  "tags": [
    [ "p", <pubkey>, "MOD>NS-nud" ],
    [ "p", <pubkey>, "MOD>FA" ]
  ],
  "content": "Lots of drawings of nude people"
}
```

#### Example 3 - Profile of a trans porn star with G-rated avatar and racy header image

Simultaneously self-reporting general theme of profile and particular parts of a profile...
```json
{
"id": "<event-id>"
    "pubkey": "<pub-key>",
    "created_at": 1000000000,
    "kind": 0,
    "tags": [
      [ "t", "TransGirl" ],
      [ "l", "MOD>PN-trn" ],
      [ "l", "MOD>PG-picture" ],
      [ "l", "MOD>PN-trn-website" ],
      [ "l", "MOD>NS-ero-banner" ]
    ],
    "content": "{\"name\":\"PollyPornstar\",\"about\":\"Award-winning trans porn star\",\"banner\":\"https://somesite.com/somepic.jpg\",\"website\":\"https://pornsite.com\",\"picture\":\"https://somesite.com/anotherpic.jpg\"}"
}
```
After the fact reporting of the same profile...
```json
{
  "kind": 1984,
  "tags": [
    [ "p", <pubkey>, "MOD>PN-trn"],
    [ "p", <pubkey>, "MOD>PG-picture"],
    [ "p", <pubkey>, "MOD>PN-trn-website"],
    [ "p", <pubkey>, "MOD>NS-ero-banner"]
  ],
  "content": "Trans porn star with racy banner and website link to a porn site."
}
```

### Future Considerations

#### Translations

The descriptions for each type and context code will need to be translated into other languages to facilitate international use.

#### Future-proofing

It is expected that the content moderation for Nostr will evolve over time and other types of data may be added to the reports. As a result, any additional data after an expected code should be ignored.
