Content Moderation Using NIP-68 Labeling
----------------------------------------

`draft` `optional` `author:s3x-jay` `author:rabble`

## Purpose

To define how content moderation can be accomplished using NIP-68 labeling.

## Background

Just as MeSH helps scientists and medical professionals communicate effectively and find articles on a particular topic quickly, people (and automated agents) performing content moderation tasks on Nostr need a defined vocabulary to communicate effectively and find and act on particular types of moderation reports quickly. 

While __content moderation is completely optional on Nostr__, this vocabulary is needed because many relay owners feel the need to stay compliant with their local laws as well as the standards and preferences of the communities they serve. Additionally, client apps need to cater to the preferences of their users and sometimes to the standards imposed by the app stores they're listed in. 

The fact that something is in a moderation vocabulary says nothing about the ethical or moral quality of that type of content. Ethical and moral standards vary widely around the world.

## The "MOD" vocabulary

This vocabulary only defines things believed to affect the most number of Nostr users. By design it is not a full, comprehensive list of every possible moderation category. More specialized or regional issues are handled by the `X-MOD` vocabulary, discussed below.

There is no requirement for anyone to use the entire vocabulary or even most of it. Different parts of the vocabulary are relevant in some contexts but not in others. Clients apps and moderators should only use the portion of the vocabulary that applies to their particular situation. Some may ignore moderation issues completely (support for this NIP is optional and support for the full `MOD` vocabulary is not required to claim an app supports this NIP).

Client apps which support content reporting should not overwhelm users with too many choices. Sub-categories should only be displayed after the user chooses the general category. Client apps are further encouraged to make use of geolocation data, if available, to hide categories/sub-categories that are not relevant in the user's country or region.

### Reportable Types

**_Format:_ AB-cde**
- where 'AB' is a mandatory 2 character, uppercase code of a major content type category
- and 'cde' is an optional 3 character, lowercase code representing a sub-category

### Contexts

Contexts are situations where otherwise objectionable content might be allowed.

**_Format:_ AB**
- where 'AB' is a mandatory 2 character, uppercase code of a major content type category

ContextCode | Context
--- | ---
ED | Educational
FA | Fine Art
FF | Fantasy / Fiction
MS | Medical / Scientific
ND | News & Documentaries
PP | Political Protest

## The X-MOD vocabulary

The MOD vocabulary does not cover all cases where content will need to be moderated - only the cases that are likely to affect the largest number of Nostr users. The X-MOD vocabulary will fill the gap of other cases that could use something better than an unstructured freeform text field.

The X-MOD vocabulary is intended to be organic. People and entities doing content moderation can implement terms as they see fit - in coordinaton with others who will use their terms. It is a good way to test the use of new terms before including those terms in the MOD vocabulary. It will also be useful for regional moderation issues that may never have enough use to be included in MOD.

The TypeCodes/ContextCodes for X-MOD do not need to follow the same structure as the MOD vocabulary unless the intent is for the code to eventually be integrated into the MOD vocabulary. In that case the format should be "AB-cde" as it is in the MOD vocabulary.

### Content moderation using labels

Content moderation will be accomplished via a mix of self-labeling (by responsible users), and 3rd party labeling after the fact. 

__This NIP deprecates both NIP-36 and NIP-56__

- NIP-36 is deprecated because labeling uses the more general `l` and `label` tags rather than the use-specific, unstructured `content-warning` tag.
- NIP-56 is deprecated because replaceable events are required for labeling and kind 1984 is not replaceable.

### Self-labeling

- Users with content that is likely to be considered "sensitive" can label their content with at the time it is published by including `l` and `label` tags in their event at the time of publishing. 
- Users can label their profile page as sensitive.
- User

```
tag: content-warning
options:
 - [reason]: may be a null or blank
 - [codes]: mandatory
```
The [reason] option was defined in NIP-36. It may be null or a blank string.

An additional mandatory option is added to the content-warning tag - [codes] - which contains a comma delimited list of relevant content type and context codes.

#### Content warnings for particular components of a profile

If NIP-36 is being used to self-report one's profile the user may classify the entire profile and/or just parts of a profile by appending the item name for the applicable part of the profile to the content type or context code. For example:

- AB-cde (would apply to the entire profile)
- AB-cde-picture (would apply to the user's avatar only)
- AB-cde-website (would apply to the link in the user's profile)

Item names used must match items specified in the `content` section of the (Kind 0) event.

## Examples

### Example 1 - Post with photos from a wet t-shirt contest

Self-reporting the post...
```json
{
    "pubkey": "<pub-key>",
    "created_at": 1000000000,
    "kind": 1,
    "tags": [
      [ "t", "WetTShirt" ],
      [ "l", "MOD>NS-ero" ],
      [ "label", "Wet t-shirt contest" ]
    ],
    "content": "(Racy content goes here)",
    "id": "<event-id>"
}
```
After the fact reporting of same post...
```json
{
  "kind": 1984,
  "tags": [
    [ "e", <eventId>, "MOD>NS-ero" ],
    [ "p", <pubkey> ]
  ],
  "content": "Wet t-shirt contest"
}
```

### Example 2 - Profile of organization offering life drawing classes

Self-reporting of an entire profile...
```json
{
"id": "<event-id>"
    "pubkey": "<pub-key>",
    "created_at": 1000000000,
    "kind": 0,
    "tags": [
      [ "t", "LifeDrawing" ],
      [ "l", "MOD>NS-nud" ],
      [ "l", "MOD>FA" ]
    ],
    "content": "{\"name\":\"OttawaLifeDrawing\",\"about\":\"Ottawa's newest life drawing classes!\"}"
}
```
After the fact reporting of same profile...
```json
{
  "kind": 1984,
  "tags": [
    [ "p", <pubkey>, "MOD>NS-nud" ],
    [ "p", <pubkey>, "MOD>FA" ]
  ],
  "content": "Lots of drawings of nude people"
}
```

### Example 3 - Profile of a trans porn star with G-rated avatar and racy header image

Simultaneously self-reporting general theme of profile and particular parts of a profile...
```json
{
"id": "<event-id>"
    "pubkey": "<pub-key>",
    "created_at": 1000000000,
    "kind": 0,
    "tags": [
      [ "t", "TransGirl" ],
      [ "l", "MOD>PN-trn" ],
      [ "l", "MOD>PG-picture" ],
      [ "l", "MOD>PN-trn-website" ],
      [ "l", "MOD>NS-ero-banner" ]
    ],
    "content": "{\"name\":\"PollyPornstar\",\"about\":\"Award-winning trans porn star\",\"banner\":\"https://somesite.com/somepic.jpg\",\"website\":\"https://pornsite.com\",\"picture\":\"https://somesite.com/anotherpic.jpg\"}"
}
```
After the fact reporting of the same profile...
```json
{
  "kind": 1984,
  "tags": [
    [ "p", <pubkey>, "MOD>PN-trn"],
    [ "p", <pubkey>, "MOD>PG-picture"],
    [ "p", <pubkey>, "MOD>PN-trn-website"],
    [ "p", <pubkey>, "MOD>NS-ero-banner"]
  ],
  "content": "Trans porn star with racy banner and website link to a porn site."
}
```

## Future Considerations

### Translations

The descriptions for each type and context code will need to be translated into other languages to facilitate international use.

### Future-proofing

It is expected that the content moderation for Nostr will evolve over time and other types of data may be added to the reports. As a result, any additional data after an expected code should be ignored.
