Content Moderation Using NIP-32 Labeling
----------------------------------------

`draft` `optional` `author:s3x-jay` `author:rabble`

## Purpose

To define how content moderation can be accomplished using NIP-32 labeling and describe how Nostr clients can use that data to filter feeds according to user preferences.

## Background

Just as the MeSH vocabulary, referenced in NIP-32, helps scientists and medical professionals communicate effectively and find articles on a particular topic quickly, people (and automated agents) performing content moderation tasks on Nostr need a defined vocabulary to communicate effectively and find and act on particular types of moderation reports quickly. 

While __content moderation is completely optional on Nostr__, these vocabularies are needed because many relay owners feel the need to stay compliant with their local laws as well as the standards and preferences of the communities they serve. Additionally, client apps need to cater to the preferences of their users and sometimes to the standards imposed by the app stores they're listed in. 

The fact that something is in a moderation vocabulary says nothing about the ethical or moral quality of that type of content. 

## Using NIP-32 labeling

NIP-32 uses the `L` and `l` tags. Use of the `L` tag is straightforward - with a namespace value of 'MOD' or 'X-MOD' (discussed below).

As allowed by NIP-32, the namespace is appended to the label in `l` tags for optimized searches, and the 4th, JSON-encoded parameter is sometimes used. For example:

```
["L", "MOD"],
["l", "MOD>IL-csa", "MOD", "{\"confidence\":1,\"degree\":1,\"support\":\"https://domain.com/csam-verifier?dbid=123\"}"]
  ],
```

## The MOD vocabulary

NIP-32 `namespace`: "MOD"

The MOD vocabulary includes moderation categories believed to address the most likely moderation cases. By design it is not a full, comprehensive list of every possible moderation category. More specialized or regional issues are handled by the `X-MOD` vocabulary, discussed below.

There is no requirement for anyone to use the entire MOD vocabulary, or even most of it. Different parts of the vocabulary are relevant in some contexts but not in others. Clients apps and moderators should only use the portion of the vocabulary that applies to their particular situation. Use of the full MOD vocabulary is not required for an app to claim it supports this NIP.

Client apps which support content reporting should not overwhelm users with too many choices. Sub-categories should only be displayed after the user chooses the general category. The two "HC" sub-categories intentionally have no general category and should be shown along with the general categories. Client apps are further encouraged to make use of geolocation data, if available, to hide categories/sub-categories that are not relevant in the user's country or region.

The MOD vocabulary is made up of reportable types and contextsâ€¦

### Reportable Types

Reportable types are categories of posts which are often moderated.

**_Format:_ "AB-cde"**
- where 'AB' is a mandatory 2 character, uppercase code of a major content type category
- and 'cde' is an optional 3 character, lowercase code representing a sub-category

TypeCode | Type | Public Notes | Development Notes
--- | --- | --- | ---
CL |  Coarse Language / Profanity | | NIP-56 equivalent: 'profanity'
HC-fin | Promotion of content that is likely to cause financial ruin | consider also Fraud & Scams |
HC-bhd | Promotion of content that is likely to cause serious bodily harm or death | |
IH | Intolerance & Hate | does not include intolerance of intolerance | |
IL | Illegal Content | post/profile itself is illegal or advocates illegal activity | NIP-56 equivalent: 'illegal'
IL-cop | Copyright violation, piracy, intellectual property theft | |
IL-csa | Child sexual abuse and/or trafficking | |
IL-drg | Drug-related crime | |
IL-frd | Fraud & Scams | |
IL-har | Harassment / stalking / doxxing | | if applicable, the npub or nprofile of the victim should be specified using `support`
IL-swk | Prostitution | | relevant countries: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostitution_by_region
IL-idt | Impersonation / identity theft / phishing | | NIP-56 equivalent: 'nudity'. if applicable, the npub or nprofile of the victim should be specified using `support`
IL-mal | Malware / viruses / ransomware | | not applicable if there is no URL or file
NA | None of the above | | for use when the user wants to report something but none of the categories or contexts apply
NS | Nudity & Sex | for use when there is no intention to arouse |
NS-nud | Casual nudity | | NIP-56 equivalent: 'nudity'
NS-ero | Erotica | |
NS-sex | Sex | |
PG | No Sensitive Content | for use in situations where sensitive content might be assumed |
PN | Pornography | for use when there is an intention to sexually arouse |
PN-het | Heterosexual porn | |
PN-gay | Gay male porn | | relevant countries: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGBT_rights_by_country_or_territory
PN-les | Lesbian porn | |
PN-bis | Bisexual porn | |
PN-trn | Transsexual porn | |
PN-fnb | Gender-fluid / non-binary porn | |
SP | Spam | | NIP-56 equivalent: 'spam'
SP-mod | Moderation report spam | | moderators should use `appliesto` (some ReportType/ContextType) and `support` (example Nostr IDs) when reporting a profile for moderation spam
VI | Violence | actual or advocated | |
VI-hum | Violence towards a human being | |
VI-ani | Violence towards a sentient animal | |

### Contexts

Contexts are situations where otherwise objectionable content might be allowed.

**_Format:_ "AB"**
- where 'AB' is a mandatory 2 character, uppercase code of a context type

ContextCode | Context
--- | ---
ED | Educational
FA | Fine Art
FF | Fantasy / Fiction
MS | Medical / Scientific
ND | News & Documentaries
PP | Political Protest

### Changes to the MOD vocabulary

People who wish to use the `MOD` vocabylary to report other types/contexts that have broad, global application should open a pull request to modify this NIP.

### Translations

The descriptions for each type and context code will need to be translated into other languages to facilitate international use. This NIP should be amended after a decision is made on how to best store and retrieve those translations.

## The X-MOD vocabulary

NIP-32 `namespace`: "X-MOD"

The MOD vocabulary does not cover all cases where content will need to be moderated - only the cases that are likely to encompass the largest number of moderation reports. The X-MOD vocabulary will fill the gap of other cases that could use something better than an unstructured free-form text field.

The X-MOD vocabulary is intended to be highly organic. People and entities doing content moderation can implement terms as they see fit - in coordination with others who will use those terms. It will also be useful for regional moderation issues that may never have enough use to be included in MOD.

The TypeCodes/ContextCodes for X-MOD do not need to follow the same structure as the MOD vocabulary.

## Variables used in the 4th parameter of `l`

It is expected that bots will, in time, contribute to the content moderation process, as will advanced users (e.g. moderators). These groups will require additional relevant information not required by regular users. Some features they will need supported are:

- `quality` is a real number between 0 and 1 which expresses how good of an example the item being labeled is of that label.
- `degree` is a real number between 0 and 1 which expresses where the item falls on a range if the label refers to a range. 
- `confidence` is a real number between 0 and 1 which expresses how certain the entity publishing the label is that the label is accurate. It will mostly be used by bots.
- `support` is an array of URLs and/or Nostr ids with information to justify the labeling.  
- `appliesto` is an array of element names and is used when `content` is a JSON encoded string and the labeling applies to only certain elements in `content`.

The features above are optional. With the possible exception of `appliesto` it is not expected that client apps aimed at regular users will make use of these features.

## Action labels

When a user specifies moderation labels, no matter if they use one of the structured vocabularies or an unstructured label, they may specify a recommended action that can be taken into consideration by those using their labeling. These labels are:

LabelCode | Meaning | Suggested defaults
--- | --- | ---
feature | The opposite of warn/filter/delete | 
display | Do not warn users about or filter this content | default for all cases of `MOD>PG`
warn-public | Warn people who do not follow the account before content is displayed | default if a context is specified
warn-all | Warn all viewers before content is displayed | default for other cases
filter | Filter content if user does not follow the account, but do not delete from relays | default for all cases of `MOD>IL`
delete | Delete content from relays, filter until that happens | 

Support of action labels is completely optional. 

A `namespace` value of `MOD` should be used with these label codes.

### Self-labeling of sensitive content at time of event publication

Users with content that is likely to be considered "sensitive" can label their content at the time it is published by including `L` and `l` tags in their event at the time of publishing. 

If the intent is to give a warning, a human-readable summary can be put in a `content-warning` tag to be backwards compatible with NIP-36.

Example: 
```json
{
    "pubkey": "<pub-key>",
    "created_at": 1000000000,
    "kind": 1,
    "tags": [
      ["t", "WetTShirt"],
      ["t", "WetTShirtContest"],
      ["L", "MOD"],
      ["l", "MOD>NS-ero", "MOD"],
      ["l", "MOD>warn-public", "MOD"],
      ["content-warning", "erotic content]
    ],
    "content": "(Racy content goes here)",
    "id": "<event-id>"
}
```

Users can self-label their own profile if other users are likely to see "sensitive" content on the profile page.

Example: 
```json
{
    "pubkey": "<pub-key>",
    "created_at": 1000000000,
    "kind": 0,
    "tags": [
      ["t", "LifeDrawing"],
      ["L", "MOD"],
      ["l", "MOD>NS-nud", "MOD"],
      ["l", "MOD>FA", "MOD"]
    ],
    "content": "{\"name\":\"OttawaLifeDrawing\",\"about\":\"Ottawa's newest life drawing classes!\"}",
    "id": "<event-id>"
}
```

Users can use labels to define the way in which certain elements of their profile may or may not be sensitive using `appliesto`. Extending that type of labeling, users can set a default, assumed label for items in their feed by saying the code applies to `feed` even though `feed` is not an element of their profile's `content`.
```
...
["l", "MOD>AB-cde", "MOD", "{\"appliesto\": \"feed\"}"]
...
```
Client apps should apply this label when MOD or X-MOD labels are not present on a post. Users can turn off their default label for a particular post by including labels in the post, or using a kind 1985 event to label the event after publication.

In the example below the user has marked their feed as "X-MOD>IL-kng" in an attempt to say they're engaged in technically illegal activity to end the monarchy in the UK. They've also noted that their avatar picture is not "sensitive", but their website advocates violence. Additionally they've specified that they are engaged in political protest which should be taken into consideration as a mitigating context.

Example:
```json
{
    "pubkey": "<pub-key>",
    "created_at": 1000000000,
    "kind": 0,
    "tags": [
      ["t", "UKrepublican"],
      ["L", "X-MOD"],
      ["l", "X-MOD>IL-kng", "X-MOD", "{\"appliesto\": \"feed\"}"],
      ["L", "MOD"],
      ["l", "MOD>PG", "MOD", "{\"appliesto\": \"picture\"}"],
      ["l", "MOD>VI-hum", "MOD", "{\"appliesto\": \"website\"}"],
      ["l", "MOD>PP", "MOD"],
      ["l", "MOD>display", "MOD"]
    ],
    "content": "{\"name\":\"EndUKMonarchy\",\"about\":\"Monarchy in the UK needs to end! (by force if necessary)\",\"banner\":\"https://somesite.com/somepic.jpg\",\"website\":\"https://somesite.com\",\"picture\":\"https://somesite.com/anotherpic.jpg\"}",
    "id": "<event-id>"
}
```

### Labeling / reporting of content after publication

Labeling after publication follows all the same conventions as labeling at the time of publication, only it uses kind 1985 and a human-readable summary is suggested in `content`.

As with other types of labeling, client apps SHOULD include an "a" tag with a `nevent`/`nprofile` that lists of all known relays where the event can be found.

Example: User reporting a post about a wet t-shirt contest...
```json
{
  "kind": 1985,
  "pubkey": "<pubkey of labeler>",
  "tags": [
    ["e", "<eventid of event being labeled>"],
    ["p", "<pubkey of event being labeled>"],
    ["a", "<`nevent`, `nprofile` with list of all known relays where event can be found>"],
    ["L", "MOD"],
    ["l", "MOD", "MOD>NS-ero"]
  ],
  "content": "Wet t-shirt contest",
  "id": "<event-id>"
}
```

Example: A nudity detection bot reporting it's finding about a post...
```json
{
  "kind": 1985,
  "pubkey": "<pubkey of labeler>",
  "tags": [
    ["e", "<eventid of event being labeled>", "<recommended relay URL>"],
    ["p", "<pubkey of event being labeled>"],
    ["a", "<`nevent`, `nprofile` with list of all known relays where event can be found>"],
    ["L", "MOD"],
    ["l", "MOD>warn-public", "MOD" ],
    ["l", "MOD>NS", "MOD", "{\"confidence\":0.62}"]
  ],
  "content": "Nudity detected (62% confidence)",
  "id": "<event-id>"
}
```

Example: A bot reporting results after it compared a file from a NIP-94 event to a database of known CSAM.
```json
{
  "kind": 1985,
  "pubkey": "<pubkey of labeler>",
  "tags": [
    ["e", "<eventid of event being labeled>", "<recommended relay URL>"],
    ["a", "<`nevent`, `nprofile` with list of all known relays where event can be found>"],
    ["p", "<pubkey of event being labeled>"],
    ["L", "MOD"],
    ["l", "MOD>delete", "MOD"],
    ["l", "MOD>IL-csa", "MOD", "{\"confidence\":1,\"degree\":1,\"support\":\"https://domain.com/csam-verifier?dbid=123\"}"]
  ],
  "content": "It is recommended that all relay owners delete this event immediately and block all future NIP-94 events with the same hash.",
  "id": "<event-id>"
}
```

Example: Suggesting that a post be featured (not all content moderation is negative)
```json
{
  "kind": 1985,
  "pubkey": "<pubkey of labeler>",
  "tags": [
    ["e", "<eventid of event being labeled>", "<recommended relay URL>"],
    ["p", "<pubkey of event being labeled>", "<recommended relay URL>"],
    ["a", "<`nevent`, `nprofile` with list of all known relays where event can be found>"],
    ["L", "MeSH"],
    ["l", "MeSH>D019142", "{\"confidence\":1,\"quality\":0.8}"],
    ["L", "GeoNames"],
    ["l", "GeoNames>203312", "{\"confidence\":1,\"support\":[\"https://www.cdc.gov/vhf/ebola/history/chronology.html\"]}",]
    ["L", "MOD"],
    ["l", "MOD>feature", "MOD"]
  ],
  "content": "Post discusses paper on the origins of Ebola.",
  "id": "<event-id>"
}
```

Example: Labeling a profile and it's component elements
```json
{
  "kind": 1985,
  "pubkey": "<pubkey of labeler>",
  "tags": [
    ["e", "<eventid of event being labeled>", "<recommended relay URL>"],
    ["p", "<pubkey of event being labeled>"],
    ["a", "<`nevent`, `nprofile` with list of all known relays where event can be found>"],
    ["L", "#t"],
    ["l", "#t>TransFem"],
    ["L", "MOD"],
    ["l", "MOD>PN-trn", "MOD", "{\"appliesto\": \"feed\"}"],
    ["l", "MOD>PG", "MOD", "{\"appliesto\": \"picture\"}"],
    ["l", "MOD>PN-trn", "MOD", "{\"appliesto\": \"website\"}"],
    ["l", "MOD>NS-ero", "MOD", "{\"appliesto\": \"banner\"}"]
  ],
  "content": "Profile is for a trans pornstar.",
  "id": "<event-id>"
}
```
Note that the example above shows how other, non-moderation labeling can be included in the same kind 1985 report along with moderation labeling.

Important: Users should not use kind 1985 events to label their own profiles. It is not a use case client apps need to support.

## Moderator lists

Use of the moderation labels to filter end-user's feeds SHOULD be faciliatated by client apps with the use of "Moderator Lists" which are a type of "categorized people list" (as defined in [NIP-51](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips/blob/master/51.md)). The `d` value for these lists should be "moderators". Client apps SHOULD follow the moderation suggestions of people on the user's moderator list. Clients MAY choose how they handle cases where they encounter conflicting moderation suggestions. They could use the least restrictive, or the most restrictive, or do some type of average.

```json
{
  "kind": 30000,
  "tags": [
    ["d", "moderators"],
    ["p", "3bf0c63fcb93463407af97a5e5ee64fa883d107ef9e558472c4eb9aaaefa459d"],
    ["p", "32e1827635450ebb3c5a7d12c1f8e7b2b514439ac10a67eef3d9fd9c5c68e245"],
  ],
  "content": "VezuSvWak++ASjFMRqBPWS3mK5pZ0vRLL325iuIL4S+r8n9z+DuMau5vMElz1tGC/UqCDmbzE2kwplafaFo/FnIZMdEj4pdxgptyBV1ifZpH3TEF6OMjEtqbYRRqnxgIXsuOSXaerWgpi0pm+raHQPseoELQI/SZ1cvtFqEUCXdXpa5AYaSd+quEuthAEw7V1jP+5TDRCEC8jiLosBVhCtaPpLcrm8HydMYJ2XB6Ixs=?iv=/rtV49RFm0XyFEwG62Eo9A==",
  ...other fields
}
```

Clients apps MAY additionally choose to support "Super Moderators" which is when the publicly visible people on the moderator list of a user's moderator are also used. Super moderator lists should be saved with a `d` tag of "moderators/super".

For example: End user Hakim has designated Julian as a "moderator" and Brigitta as a "Super Moderator". Brigitta has listed Jiang publicly on her moderator list and also has Fatima listed but privately/encrypted. In that scenario Hakim's feed would be filtered based on the moderation labeling by: Julian, Brigitta and Jiang (but not Fatima or anyone Julian may have on his moderator list). 

Repeating the above example for super moderatorsâ€¦

```json
{
  "kind": 30000,
  "tags": [
    ["d", "moderators/super"],
    ["p", "3bf0c63fcb93463407af97a5e5ee64fa883d107ef9e558472c4eb9aaaefa459d"],
    ["p", "32e1827635450ebb3c5a7d12c1f8e7b2b514439ac10a67eef3d9fd9c5c68e245"],
  ],
  "content": "VezuSvWak++ASjFMRqBPWS3mK5pZ0vRLL325iuIL4S+r8n9z+DuMau5vMElz1tGC/UqCDmbzE2kwplafaFo/FnIZMdEj4pdxgptyBV1ifZpH3TEF6OMjEtqbYRRqnxgIXsuOSXaerWgpi0pm+raHQPseoELQI/SZ1cvtFqEUCXdXpa5AYaSd+quEuthAEw7V1jP+5TDRCEC8jiLosBVhCtaPpLcrm8HydMYJ2XB6Ixs=?iv=/rtV49RFm0XyFEwG62Eo9A==",
  ...other fields
}
```

Taking things a step further, client apps are encouraged to experiment with the concept "Anti-moderators" where one does the opposite of whatever moderation action is suggested. For example, "Political Party A" may choose their opponent, "Political Party B", as their anti-moderator which would result in posts that Party B want filtered or deleted actually getting promoted, and posts that Party B want promoted would get filtered. This will allow the negative energy of content moderation to be used in positive ways. It would also mean overly aggressive reporting could actually be counter-productive. 

Anti-moderators lists should be saved with a `d` value of "moderators/anti". 

### Bots can be moderators

It's important to note that "people" on a user's moderator list may very well be bots, not actual people. For example if there were a bot that scanned for CSAM and issued moderation label events that reflected the results of its scan - that bot's Nostr ID could be included in someone's moderator list. 

### Base-level moderation

Further there may be situations where apps want to enable (or have the option to enable) a certain base level of content moderation. For example if the app was designed to be used by children, or it needed to meet certain standards to get approved by an app store. In these cases they could insert certain moderators into the user's moderator list. If a client app implements base-level moderation it MUST clearly describe the moderation to the user, not just when the user installs the app, but also within the app (e.g. on the Settings page). 

Base-level moderation needn't be seen a form of censorship by the app developer. They can offer a number of "default moderation styles" for users. Things like "Christian conservative", "Big city liberal", "Environmental activist", "Thai monarchist", and obviously the option for no moderation at all. Then users could pick the moderation style that best suit their personal convictions. 

## Relay features needed to support this NIP

For a relay to say it supports this NIP it MUST support the ability for unpaid relay users to submit kind 1985 events that have `namespace` values of "MOD" or "X-MOD", and are related to content on the relay (`e` tag equal to an eventID in the relay database). That ability SHOULD be on by default, but MAY be turned off by the relay webmaster.

This solves an existing legal problem for relay owners where an unpaid user may be able to read an event, but they can not submit a report about the event - leaving the relay owner in the position where they are unaware they are hosting potentially illegal content. 

Because opening content reporting up to the public creates a vector for bad actors to submit malicious moderation reports, relays MAY require Proof-of-Work (as defined in [NIP-13](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips/blob/master/13.md)) with a reasonable level of difficulty for these particular types of events (kind 1985, `namespace` = MOD|X-MOD). Relays may require different levels of difficulty for different IPs (e.g. raising difficulty level for data center IPs, lowering it for residential IPs). The minimum required difficulty required of the user should be published in the relay's [NIP-11](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips/blob/master/11.md) relay information document using the field `min_pow_moderation`.

Relays SHOULD return a useful, standardized response to the client if a moderation report is refused. These are:
- "Insufficient PoW"
- "Reported content not found"

Client apps SHOULD inform the user if a relay refuses to accept their moderation report and the reason for the refusal, if known. If the client app does not support PoW and it detects a relay requires PoW or if the difficulty is higher than the client can easily support, the client SHOULD inform the user to use a different client to submit the report.
